These modules are part of my coursera course.

This course deals with all things server-side. Entire course goes around the NodeJS platform. We Started with overview of the Web protocols: HTTP and HTTPS. Then examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for building web servers. On the database side,  review basic CRUD operations, NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS. Examine the REST concepts and building a RESTful API. Touch upon authentication and security. 
Finally a review on backend as a service (BaaS) approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services.

At the end of this course, I am be able to:

- Demonstrate an understanding of server-side concepts, CRUD and REST
- Build and configure a backend server using NodeJS framework
- Build a RESTful API for the front-end to access backend services
